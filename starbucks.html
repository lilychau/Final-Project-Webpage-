<h1>Our Heritage</h1> 
	<p> 
	
Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help <br> make the world a little better. It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.<br>
Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow <br>storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, <br>inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.<br>
In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer) had first walked into a Starbucks <br>store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.<br>
In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the <br> <strong> coffee experience. </strong> He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States.<br> A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. <br>He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned <br>in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.<br>
From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee <br>and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.<br>
Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.<br>

<h1> Expect More Than Coffee </h1>
<p>
We’re not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else that goes with a full and rewarding <br>coffeehouse experience. We also offer a selection of premium teas, fine pastries<br> and other delectable treats to please the taste buds.<br> And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal.<br>
It’s not unusual to see people coming to Starbucks to chat, meet up or even work. We’re a neighborhood <br>gathering place, a part of the daily routine – and we couldn’t be happier about it. <br>Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew.<br>
We make sure everything we do is through the lens of humanity – from our commitment to the highest quality<br> coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do<br> business responsibly.<br>
